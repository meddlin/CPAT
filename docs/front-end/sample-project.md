# Sample Project: Redux Table

In order to demonstrate these tools in a more practical way, we'll be building an example project called, `redux-table`.

- Display a table
- Enable create, read, update, delete functionality on each row
- Allow table to paginate across data

## API

The example API is a C#, .NET Core 3.x Web API. It's built with the intention of modeling basic CRUD (cread, read, update, delete) actions.

## Deployment

The project development environment can be executed with Docker.
