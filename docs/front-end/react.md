React.js Standards

## General Applications

### Toolchain

CRA - Create React App
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

Stay on this for as long as possible.

CRA provides a means for quickly getting started with React and moving forward.
It is an integrated toolchain for React which largely sets up and handles
webpack for you. It's robust enough to handle moderate configurations and deploy
to production.

**Recommendation**: *Stay with CRA until your deployment needs become too
demanding and/or cumbersome

## Documentation (Site)

### Gatsby.js
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/

Gatsby.js is a static site generator built with React and GraphQL. However, don't
let the "static" part of the explanation make you think it can't have dynamic
capabilities.

**Recommendation**: *The idea for an interactive documentation website should
likely be accomplished with Gatsby.*
