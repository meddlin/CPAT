# Redux: "Practically" In-Depth

For a deep-dive on the individual methods and inner-workings of redux, it is recommended to reference the Redux documentation. Here, we'll walk through an example which covers about ~80% of what is needed when working with Redux.

- [Redux Docs - Getting Started](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
- [Redux Docs - Advanced Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/advanced/advanced-tutorial)

As for the rest of this document, it is written assuming you are starting with an already running React app created with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
