# File Storage

Inevitably OSINT tools will output individual files (flat, binary, images, etc.) that need storage and indexing. We need a way to upload these files from the python-osint API to some kind of storage.

# Write a File Server API

We could add one more service to CPAT--a file server. Unsure how this would work for decentralizing data, but we at least get the data stored.
